    # creating a new file without leaving broot
    { invocation: "touch {new_file}", execution: "touch {directory}/{new_file}", leave_broot: false }

    # A convenient shortcut to create new text files in
    #  the current directory or below
    { invocation: "create {subpath}", execution: "$EDITOR {directory}/{subpath}", leave_broot: false }

    { invocation: "git_diff", shortcut: "gd", leave_broot: false, execution: "git difftool -y {file}" }

    # On ctrl-b, propose the creation of a copy of the selection.
    # While this might occasionally be useful, this verb is mostly here
    # as an example to demonstrate rare standard groups like {file-stem}
    # and {file-dot-extension} and the auto_exec verb property which
    # allows verbs to stay unexecuted until you hit enter
    {
        invocation: "bak {version}",
        key: "ctrl-b",
        leave_broot: false,
        auto_exec: false
        execution: "cp -r {file} {parent}/{file-stem}.bak.{version}{file-dot-extension}"
    }

    # By default, `rm` does the system rm, and completely removes
    # the file. If you prefer to have the file moved to the system
    # trash, you may use the ':trash' internal with the verb below:
    # { invocation: "rm", internal: "trash", leave_broot: false }

    # This verb lets you launch a terminal on ctrl-T
    # (on exit you'll be back in broot)
    # { invocation: "terminal", key: "ctrl-t", execution: "$SHELL", set_working_dir: true, leave_broot: false }

    # Here's an example of a verb needing the shell capabilities.
    # It copies all children of the currently selected directory
    #  to a destination you type.
    # It uses a star, which needs the shell for expansion. That's
    #  why such verb must have the `from_shell: true` parameter.
    { invocation: "cpa {dest}", external: "cp -r {directory}/* {dest}", from_shell: true }

    { key: "ctrl-f", cmd: ":toggle_files" }

    # Here's an example of a shortcut bringing you to your home directory
    { invocation: "cdhome", internal: ":focus ~"  }

    # Here's going to the work-dir root of the current git repository
    { invocation: "cdroot", execution: ":focus {git-root}" }

    # A popular set of shortcuts for going up and down:
    #
    { key: "ctrl-u", execution: ":page_up" }
    { key: "ctrl-d", execution: ":page_down" }
    #
    # Add to stage and move
    { key: "ctrl-p", execution: ":previous_match" }
    { key: "ctrl-n", execution: ":next_match" }
    { key: "ctrl-j", invocation: "stage_go_next", cmd: ":toggle_stage;:next_match" }
    { key: "ctrl-k", invocation: "stage_go_next", cmd: ":toggle_stage;:previous_match" }


    # broot defaults ctrl- conflicts with macos shortcuts, thus adding this:
    { key: "ctrl-1", execution: ":panel_left_no_open" }
    { key: "ctrl-2", execution: ":panel_right" }

    { invocation: "cdinitialroot", execution: ":focus {initial-root}" }
    { invocation: "cdup", internal: ":focus .." }
    { invocation: "go {path}", internal: ":focus {path}" } // make :go an alias of :focus
